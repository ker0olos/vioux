# vioux
A proof-of-concept scripting-based video editor

vioux stands for video input output user experience
the name is a placeholder

the idea of the project is to create scripting-based video editor
with bare-minimum features included and everything else is added through community addons and/or user scripts
so the main focus points of this project isn't features but the ui/ux and the scripting library

the app will be build with rust for speed and cross-platform
idealy using either https://github.com/iced-rs/iced or https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus

the scripting library should support python for accessibility
python is easy-to-use and much better for writing small scripts

the scripting library will of course be in rust but will offically provide python bindings

one of those will do the job but i haven't reseached yet which one is more fitting for this task
